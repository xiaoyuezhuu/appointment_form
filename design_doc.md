# Appointment Form Application - Design Document

## Overview
A simple mobile-friendly appointment scheduling form built with Python and Streamlit, allowing users to submit appointment requests through an online form.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend/Backend**: Streamlit (Python framework for building web apps)
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Storage**: CSV file (initial version), with potential to upgrade to database
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or similar platform

## Features
1. **Basic Information Collection**
   - Name
   - Contact information (email, phone)
   - Appointment type/reason
   - Preferred date and time
   - Additional notes/comments

2. **Form Validation**
   - Required field validation
   - Email/phone format validation
   - Date/time validation

3. **Confirmation**
   - Submission confirmation page/message
   - Option to send email confirmation

4. **Admin Features** (future enhancement)
   - View submitted appointments
   - Accept/reject appointments
   - Schedule management

## Mobile Considerations
- Responsive design elements
- Simple, touch-friendly input controls
- Minimal data entry where possible (dropdowns, date pickers)
- Fast loading with minimal assets

## Data Flow
1. User fills out form
2. Data is validated
3. Data is stored in CSV file
4. Confirmation is shown to user

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Basic Form**
   - Create Streamlit app with form inputs
   - Implement basic validation
   - Set up CSV data storage

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
   - Add email confirmation
   - Improve styling and mobile experience
   - Add date/time selection widgets

3. **Phase 3: Deployment**
   - Deploy to hosting platform
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Gather feedback and iterate
